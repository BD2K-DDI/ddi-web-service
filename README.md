Data Discovery Index web-service
=========================

A RESTful web service providing access to the European Bioinformatics Institute Data Discovery Index.

In-dev prototype deployed here: (soon). 

#### End points

Detailed and functional documentation will be available thanks to [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api) once the
web-service is deployed. As a summary, these are the available end-points for the web service:

* `stast`: statistics about the data in the DDI project. 
* `datatset`: information about datasets, such as search, terms frequency etc.
